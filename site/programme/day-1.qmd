> The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). Bash is the default shell on most modern implementations of Unix and in most packages that provide Unix-like tools for Windows. Note that ‘Git Bash’ is a piece of software that enables Windows users to use a Bash like interface when interacting with Git ([the Carpentries](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/))

The aim of this workshop is to provide an introduction to the Bash shell. We will cover the following topics:

- File and directory navigation
- File editing
- Logging in to remote machines
- Transferring files
- Running scripts

# Prerequisites

- A laptop with a terminal. On Windows we recommend installing Git Bash. [More info](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/chapters/terminal.html)
