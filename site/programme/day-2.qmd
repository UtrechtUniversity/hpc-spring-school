Git is a distributed version control system that is becoming the standard for working with code in research projects. It helps to track changes in code and allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git projects and facilitates collaboration and working on different systems. This makes it a powerful tool: it allows you to work on your code on your local PC as well as on HPC or cloud systems, while the code is always synchronized via the central repository on GitHub.

This workshop aims to provide an introduction to Git and GitHub using the command line. We will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to version control
- Branching and merging

This workshop is a prerequisite for most of the other workshops in this Spring School.

## Prerequisites

- A laptop with Git installed and a GitHub account [Instructions](https://utrechtuniversity.github.io/workshop-computational-reproducibility/chapters/git-and-github.html)
- Basic knowledge of the command line (e.g. [Introduction to Bash](/programme/day-1)).
