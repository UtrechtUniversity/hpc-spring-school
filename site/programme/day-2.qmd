Git is a distributed version control system that is widely used in software development. It helps to track changes in source code during software development and allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase. GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. GitHub facilitates collaboration and working on different (remote) machines. This makes it a powerful tool especially when utilizing HPC and cloud resources: it allows you to work on your code on your local PC as well as on HPC or cloud systems, while the code is always synchronized via the central repository on GitHub.

This workshop aims to provide an introduction to Git and GitHub:

- Introduction to version control
- Branching and merging
