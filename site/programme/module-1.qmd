Do you need a platform where you can work interactively with your software? Do you have high requirements for compute power? Or do you want a platform where you can work collaboratively on code and (sensitive) data? Then the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is your solution.

During this extended introduction to the SURF Research Cloud, you will learn how to:

- Manage your project using [SRAM]()
- Create workspaces (aka VRE/Servers/VMs) in the Research Cloud portal
- Interactively work with your workspace via the browser and command
- Transfer data to and from your workspace
- Installing software on your workspace (e.g. python or R packages)

Prerequisites:

- none, but [Introduction to Bash](./day-1.qmd) and [Introduction to Git](day-2.qmd) are recommended they will increase your options to efficiently work with the workspaces.
