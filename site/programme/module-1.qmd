Do you need a platform where you can work interactively with your software? Do you have high requirements for compute power (CPU or GPU)? Or do you want a platform where you can work collaboratively on code and (sensitive) data? Then a Virtual Research Environment (VRE) in SURF Research Cloud is your solution.

During this extended introduction to the SURF Research Cloud, you will learn how to:

- Manage your project using [SRAM]()
- Create workspaces (aka VRE/Servers/VMs) in the Research Cloud portal
- Interactively work with your workspace via the browser and command line
- Transfer data to and from your workspace
- Installing software on your workspace (e.g. python or R packages)
- Run your first script!

Prerequisites:

- none, but [Introduction to Bash](./day-1.qmd) and [Introduction to Git](day-2.qmd) are recommended as they will increase your options to efficiently work with the workspaces.

**Find the registration link on the [main page](day-5.qmd) of this day**
