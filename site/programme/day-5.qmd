Do you need a platform where you can work interactively with your software? Do you have high requirements for compute power? Or do you want a platform where you can work collaboratively on code and (sensitive) data? Then the Virtual Research Environment (VRE) is your solution.

This workshop day will consist of several modules, from getting started with the SURF Research Cloud to more advanced topics. 

- Module 1: [Getting started with VRE]
- Module 2: [Automating workflows using the SURF Research Cloud API]
- Module 3: [tbd]


Are you an existing user?

- You can register for the advanced sessions of your interest.

Are you a new user with a solid technical or programming background?

- You can register for both the basic and advanced sessions.

Are you a new user without a technical background?

- You can register for the Getting started session.

Prerequisites:

- none, but [Introduction to Bash](./day-1.qmd) and [Introduction to Git](day-2.qmd) are recommended as it will increase your options to work with the VREs.
