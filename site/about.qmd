## About

This Spring School offers a wide range of sessions spread over eight days. Experts from Utrecht University and SURF will provide training in scientific computation, parallel programming, and deep learning. Each workshop has their own registration form, so interested participants can choose workshops that are most relevant to them. Note that some workshops have prerequisites, so please make sure to check the requirements before registering.

The Spring School is free of charge and open to all researchers and students. Registration is required and a no show policy is in place.
